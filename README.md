OKTEN school | JavaScript final project
Originally, I made transfer of search parameters using a URL, but this will increase the quantity of fetch 
requests to the server and potentially make the UI a little bit less pleasant.
As I had already received it, I decided to pass it over through session storage.
An alternative code is in the comments.

Normally, all JS files should in separate folder and not in HTML file, but, in our case, it is not so much code, and 
I left the corresponding code in HTML files.
