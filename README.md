OKTEN school | JavaScript final project

At first, I made transfer of search parameters using a URL, but this will increase the quantity of fetch 
requests to the server and potentially make the UE a little bit less pleasant.
As it received it already , I decided to pass it over through session storage.
An alternative code is in the comments.

Normally, all JS files should be in separate folder, but, in our case, it is not so much code, and 
I left the corresponding code in HTML files.
